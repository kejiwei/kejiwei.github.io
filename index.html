<p>
    I am a tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at the
    <a href="https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/">School of Economics and Management</a>, Tongji University.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My research lies at the intersection of data analytics, optimization, and transportation, with a particular
    emphasis on aviation operations. I develop data-driven optimization methods to address real-world challenges
    in airline planning, disruption management, and large-scale decision-making.
