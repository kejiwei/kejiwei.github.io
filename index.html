          <li>In September 2018, I <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">collaborated</a> with the Boston Globe and Boston Public Schools to study the impact of changing the start times in Boston, with a potential for $18M in yearly savings for the district, better student health and equity.</li>
          <li>In Spring 2017, I won the $30K <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge">Boston Public Schools Transportation Challenge</a> together with <a href="https://adelarue.github.io/">Arthur Delarue</a> and Dimitris Bertsimas. 
          Our bus routing algorithm is now implemented and <b>we are routing tens of thousands of students to school every day</b>. It saves $5M dollars every year, reallocated to better serve the children of Boston.</li>
          <li>I worked as a software engineer intern at <strong>Google</strong> in Summer 2016, developing novel algorithms
              to improve maps and navigation data using large geolocation datasets (> 100Gb). </li>
          <li>In 2014, I was a visiting researcher for five months in <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> under <a href="http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu">Pr. Alexandre Bayen</a> supervision.</li>
          <li>In 2013 won a <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/fondation/prix-jean-louis-gerondeau-zodiac-aerospace"> â‚¬10K innovation prize</a> for a smart bicycle <strong>start-up</strong> project.</p>
