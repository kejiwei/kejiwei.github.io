<p>
    I am an Assistant Professor in Operations at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/"> Kellogg School of Management</a>, Northwestern University.
</p>
<p>
    My research is at the interface of analytics, transportation, and public policy.
    I try to design scalable algorithms and decision-making tools that improve transportation efficiency and positively affect society.
</p>
<p>
    In particular, I work with school districts (San Francisco, Boston) to implement transparent and equitable transportation policies that save millions of dollars.
    This line of work <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf">changed Boston's public school transportation system in 2017</a>, and also, <a href="https://www.sfusd.edu/schools/enroll/resources/school-start-and-end-times-2022-23">changed most of San Francisco's schools schedules in 2021</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    I am also interested in online platform operations and the gig economy. Notably, I recently helped <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3534678.3539141"> Lyft change its online matching algorithm</a>, savings tens of millions of dollars every year and benefiting both drivers and passengers.
