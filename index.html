<p>
    I am an Assistant Professor in Operations at the <a href="https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/">School of Economics and Management </a>, Tongji University University.
</p>
<p>
    My research focuses on the intersection of data analytics, optimization, and transportation, with a particular emphasis on the aviation industry.
    By leveraging data-driven approaches, I seek to address challenges in aviation operations and contribute to the optimization of transportation systems.

    In particular, I work with <a href="https://www.cae.com/">CAE Inc.  (Canadian Aviation Electronics) </a> to embarked on a project to redesign the airline recovery system and has demonstrated considerably faster solution times compared to previous methods.
