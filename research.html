                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Flight timetabling can greatly impact an airline’s operating profit, yet data-driven or model-based solutions to support it remain limited. Timetabling optimization is significantly complicated by two factors. First, it exhibits strong interdependencies with subsequent fleet assignment decisions of the airlines. Second, flights’ departure and arrival times are important determinants of passenger connection opportunities, of the attractiveness of each (nonstop or connecting) itinerary, and, in turn, of passengers’ booking decisions. Because of these complicating factors, most existing approaches rely on incremental timetabling. This paper introduces an original integrated optimization approach to comprehensive flight timetabling and fleet assignment under endogenous passenger choice. Passenger choice is captured by a discrete-choice generalized attraction model. The resulting optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. This paper also proposes an original multiphase solution approach, which effectively combines several heuristics, to optimize the network-wide timetable of a major airline within a realistic computational budget. Using case study data from Alaska Airlines, computational results suggest that the combination of this paper’s model formulation and solution approaches can result in significant profit improvements as compared with the most advanced incremental approaches to flight timetabling. Additional computational experiments based on several extensions also demonstrate the benefits of this modeling and computational framework to support various types of strategic airline decision making in the context of frequency planning, revenue management, and postmerger integration.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Background. In response to demand for fast and efficient clinical testing, the use of point-of-care testing (POCT) has become increasingly common in the United States. However, studies of POCT implementation have found that adopting POCT may not always be advantageous relative to centralized laboratory testing. Methods. We construct a simulation model of patient flow in an outpatient care setting to evaluate tradeoffs involved in POCT implementation across multiple dimensions, comparing measures of patient outcomes in varying clinical scenarios, testing regimes, and patient conditions. Results. We find that POCT can significantly reduce clinical time for patients, as compared to traditional testing regimes, in settings where clinic and central testing areas are far apart. However, as distance from clinic to central testing area decreased, POCT advantage over central laboratory testing also decreased, in terms of time in the clinical system and estimated subsequent productivity loss. For example, testing for pneumonia resulted in an estimated average of 27.80 (central lab) versus 15.50 (POCT) total lost productive hours in a rural scenario, and an average of 14.92 (central lab) versus 15.50 (POCT) hours in a hospital-based scenario. Conclusions. Our results show that POCT can effectively reduce the average time a patient spends in the system for varying condition profiles and clinical scenarios. However, the number of total lost productive hours, a more holistic measure, is greatly affected by testing quality, where POCT often is at a disadvantage. Thus, it is important to consider factors such as clinical setting, target condition, testing costs, and test quality when selecting appropriate testing regime.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We propose, optimize, and validate a methodological framework for estimating the extent of the crew-propagated delays and disruptions (CPDDs). We identify the
                    factors that influence the extent of the CPDDs and incorporate them into a robust crewscheduling model. We develop a fast heuristic approach for solving the inverse of this
                    robust crew-scheduling problem to generate crew schedules that are similar to real-world
                    crew-scheduling samples. We develop a sequence of exact and heuristic techniques to
                    quickly solve the forward problem within a small optimality gap for network sizes that
                    are among the largest in robust crew-scheduling literature. Computational results using
                    four large real-world airline networks demonstrate that the crew schedules produced by
                    our approach generate propagation patterns similar to those observed in the real world.
                    Extensive out-of-sample validation tests indicate that the parameters calibrated for one
                    network perform reasonably well for other networks. We provide new insights into the
                    perceived trade-off between planned costs and delay costs as reflected by actual airline
                    crew schedules. Finally, we present a general approach to estimate the CPDDs for any
                    given network using our methodological framework under a variety of data availability
                    scenarios.

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Rail-guided vehicles (RGVs) are widely employed in automated freight handling system (AFHS) to transport surging air cargo. Energy-efficient routing of such vehicles is of great interest for both financial and environmental sustainability. Given a multi-capacity RGV working on a linear track in AFHS, we consider its optimal routing under two-sided loading/unloading (TSLU) operations, in which energy consumption is minimized under conflict-avoidance and time window constraints. The energy consumption takes account of dynamics and routing-dependent gross weight of the RGV. And the conflict-avoidance constraints ensure conflict-free transport service under TSLU operations. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and solved by incorporating valid inequalities that exploit structural properties of the problem. The static problem model and solution approach are then integrated with a rolling-horizon approach to solve the dynamic routing problem where air cargo enters and departs from the system dynamically in time. Simulation results suggest that the proposed strategy is able to route a RGV to transport air cargo with an energy cost that is considerably lower than one of the most common heuristic methods implemented in current practice.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> When quantitative models are used to support decision-making on complex and important topics, understanding a model's ``reasoning'' can increase trust in its predictions, expose hidden biases, or reduce vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, the concept of interpretability remains loosely defined and application-specific. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework in which machine learning models are constructed in a sequence of interpretable steps. We show that for a variety of models, a natural choice of interpretable steps recovers standard interpretability proxies (e.g., sparsity in linear models). We then generalize these proxies to yield a parametrized family of consistent measures of model interpretability. This formal definition allows us to quantify the ``price'' of interpretability, i.e., the tradeoff with predictive accuracy. We demonstrate practical algorithms to apply our framework on real and synthetic datasets.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> When predictive models are used to support complex and important decisions, the ability to explain a model's reasoning can increase trust, expose hidden biases, and reduce vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, attempts at interpreting models are often ad hoc and application-specific, and the concept of interpretability itself is not well-defined. We propose a general optimization framework to create explanations for linear models. Our methodology decomposes a linear model into a sequence of models of increasing complexity using coordinate updates on the coefficients. Computing this decomposition optimally is a difficult optimization problem for which we propose exact algorithms and scalable heuristics. By solving this problem, we can derive a parametrized family of interpretability metrics for linear models that generalizes typical proxies, and study the tradeoff between interpretability and predictive accuracy.

The core task in passenger transportation systems planning can be described as one of matching the network-wide demand with adequate capacity by deploying resources over the corresponding parts of the network. A prime challenge inherent in this task is the uncertainty in demand and supply in transportation systems. Demand uncertainty manifests itself in the form of the passenger choice behavior. Supply uncertainty presents itself as delays and disruptions in resource availability. This thesis tackles a set of three related research questions within passenger transportation systems while explicitly incorporating the inherent uncertainty in both demand and supply during the planning phases of air and urban transportation systems.

Flight delay propagation results in enormous additional operating costs for the airlines, passengers and the aviation system as a whole. The first part of this thesis is focused on proposing, optimizing and validating a methodological framework for estimating the extent of crew-propagated delays and disruptions. We identify the factors that influence the extent of crew-propagated delays, and incorporate them into a robust crew scheduling model. We then develop a fast heuristic approach for solving the inverse of this robust crew scheduling problem to generate crew schedules that are similar to real-world crew scheduling samples. Along with various other findings, our results show that airlines avoid up to 80\% of crew-related delays through advanced planning methods.

The second part of this thesis introduces an original integrated optimization approach to comprehensive flight timetabling and fleet assignment under endogenous passenger choice. The resulting optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. We propose an original multi-phase solution approach, which effectively combines several heuristics, to optimize the network-wide timetable of a major airline within a realistic computational budget. Using case study data from Alaska Airlines, computational results suggest that the combination of this model formulation and solution approaches can result in significant profit improvements, as compared to the most advanced incremental approaches to flight timetabling. Additional computational experiments based on several extensions also demonstrate the benefits of this modeling and computational framework to support various types of strategic airline decision-making in the context of frequency planning, revenue management, and post-merger integration.

The popularity of ridehailing services like Didi, Lyft, and Uber has soared recently. While ridehailing services offer a very convenient mode of urban transportation for many passengers, these additional vehicles on the road contribute to urban road traffic congestion, and in some cases are held responsible for falling public transit ridership. A high quality public transit system is an effective means to alleviate urban road traffic congestion, but the interdependence between transit ridership, ridehailing ridership and urban road traffic congestion motivates the following question: can public transit and ridehailing co-exist and thrive to improve the overall social welfare? To answer this question, we develop a novel mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model, and a new set of solution algorithms to optimize transit timetables. Our model explicitly accounts for the impacts on road congestion and the passengers' mode-switching behavior between transit and ridehailing services. </em>.
