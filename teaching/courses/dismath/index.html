            <h2>Course Description and Goals:</h2>
                <li>
                <p>Discrete Mathematics is what one needs to talk about most problems in computer science which involves discrete objects such as bits, integers, files in a directory, nodes in a network, etc. At the end of this course, students will be comfortable understanding and using this language. The other main objective is to read, write, and understand rigorous mathematical proofs of propositions involving these discrete objects.
                </p>
                </li>

             <h2>Text Book </h2>
                <li>
                <p>I will post lecture slides for every class. There is no required textbook. However, the course will loosely follow a text by
                    Kenneth H. Rosen, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Its-Applications-Seventh/dp/0073383090"> Discrete Mathematics and Its Application,  屈婉玲 耿素云 张立昂, <a href="https://item.jd.com/13041609.html"> 离散数学</a>. <i> It is not necessary to buy this text </i>
                </p>
                </li>
            
            <h2>Learning Objectives
                If you do well in this course, by the end of it, you will
                <ul>
                    <li>be able to read mathematical notation and terminology fluently;</li>
                    <li>become comfortable with mathematical thinking that allows you to write clean, logical, proofs;</li>
                    <li>become familiar with a number of discrete structures that are used throughout computer science;</li>
                    <li>achieve a certain clarity of thinking and expression that (as a side effect) enables you to write correct and efficient code more easily.</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

                    <li><p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Students are expected to be respectful of their peers and the instructor. This includes not talking while others are talking, not using electronic devices in class, and not engaging in any other behavior that is disruptive to the learning environment.</p></li>
                    <li>All exams (include Intermediate exams) submitted for credit must be your own (without help for any electronic devices).</li>
                    <li>If you feel that the grader has not graded accurately then you should compose an email/wechat clearly writing down which problem and your reason why you think the grading is incorrect. If you are unsatisfied by the grader's response, then you can email the me (kejiwei@tongji.edu.cn) for a full regrade. I will look at the entire problem set and re-grade it completely.</li>
