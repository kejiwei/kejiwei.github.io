## Course Description and Goals

Discrete Mathematics is essential for discussing most problems in computer science that involve discrete objects, such as bits, integers, files in a directory, nodes in a network, etc. By the end of this course, students will understand and use this language confidently. Additionally, the course will focus on reading, writing, and understanding rigorous mathematical proofs related to these objects.

## Background Assumed

Students should have a basic knowledge of programming and some familiarity with basic mathematics.
